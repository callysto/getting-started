    "This notebook is an extension and in some ways more transparent (if only by putting the inflation adjustemetns front an center) version of the LA time article available from the March 17, 2017 story [\"Wages rise on California farms. Americans still don’t want the job\"](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-farms-immigration/). In this notebook, we've changed it so you may apply the inflation adjusments yourself, as well as compare multiple state wages together. Additionally, we've added the \"Data processing, hosting and related services\" industries to the data set for a comparison of wage growth between the two."
