    "As high quality open data is becoming available, having the skills to analyze that data is becoming more important. In this notebook series we will walk  through the basics of working with open data using a Jupyter notebook. We will also demonstrate some of the first steps you may take to perform data exploration and visualization. These are introductory notebooks for someone who may not have seen any code or a Jupyter notebook before. As such, we will walk through each step involved in detail and keep our analysis at a high level. Of course, that is not to say a high level analysis can also lead to interesting conclusions or realizations.\n",

    "# Bringing Open Data Into Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to load open data into Jupyter is using a Python package called pandas. Pandas is a free and open source library for Python that allows you to manipulate and analyze almost any data  easily and quickly. It can load CSV files, spreadsheets, text files, and even tables directly from webpages. In essence, you can think of the pandas library as \"Excel on steroids\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For this first demonstration, we will walk you through the process of downloading, manipulating, and visualizing an open data set from an open data portal. We'll be using this website: [data.opendatasoft.com](https://data.opendatasoft.com). In particular we will be using a rather large data set of vehicle fuel economy available at [this link](https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/us-vehicle-fuel-economy-data-1984-2017%40kapsarc/table/?disjunctive.make&disjunctive.model&sort=-year). If you travel to that page, you should see a data set like the picture below.\n",

    "If you click the link beside your desired file format, you could download that directly to your computer. As we're working on the hub, it might be tedious to download the file to our computer then re-upload it to the hub. Instead, we will get this notebook to download that data directly from the site. If you right click on the link besides the CSV file and click \"Copy Link Address\" you'll get the path to the actual data file. We will be using this link to download the car data into Jupyter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can download that data we have a few book keeping items to take care of. First, we need to import the pandas library and set our environment up to place any graphs or visualizations we make directly into the notebook. This is done in the cell below. "

We went through some basic filtering of a data set using `pandas` as well as how to create plots easily and effectively from the data. While we did not draw any interesting conclusions in this analysis, this represents a first initial step in data exploration. In part two of this notebook, we will outline the basics of data aggregation to discover more exciting and interesting trends hiding in this data set. In part two, we will start to tease more interesting trends out of this data set."
